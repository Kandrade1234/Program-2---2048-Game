# Program-2---2048-Game
By Kevin Andrade--
Can you win and get the 2048th tile? Sure you can! This puzzle game is intended to get your brain cells going, and with enough time and practice you will eventually become a pro!

This app is made on android studio, dedicated for android platforms. There are a bunch of techniques and tools used in this program, such as button animations, background music, a score tracker, matrix manipulation,  a pretty background, and so on!

The objective of the game is to add two of the same numbered tiles to get a bigger tile; and if you play your *tiles* right, you will get 2048, but be careful! If you make the wrong move and the grid is full of no possible combinations, then you will get the loser screen and will start all over! But if you play your “cards” right then you will get 2048 and win!
